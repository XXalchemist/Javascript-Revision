## 1. JavaScript

**JavaScript** often abbreviated as **JS**, is a programming language that confirms to the **ECMAScript** specification.JavaScript is :-

- High-level
- Just-in-time compiled
- Multi-paradigm
- Dynamic typing
   
_It has curly-bracket syntax, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions._

## 2. Adding JS to the HTML file

### Internal

_To write JS code in same HTML file._

```HTML
<script>
    code blocks..
</script>
```

### External

_When JS code is written in different file._

```HTML
<script src = 'JS file location with name eg. /a.js'>
</script>
```

## 3. JS Datatypes

- *Numbers* : To describe any numbers.
- *String*  : To describe any sequence of characters.
- *Boolean* : To describe True or False.
- *Null*    : Explicity set a variable with no value.
- *Undefined*: For Variables that have not yet been defined.
- *Object*   : To describe real world objects.
- *Symbol*   : To uniquely identify objects.

```JS
let age = 21;                   // Number
let lastName = "Krishna";       // String
let fullName = {firstName:"Narayan", lastName:"Krishna"};           // Object
let checkFlag = true           // Boolean
let fav                        // Undefined
let symbolOne = Symbol()       // Symbol
```
`git checkout JS_Datatypes //includes more examples in index.html`

## 4. Variables, Constants, NAN and Comments

### Variables and Constants

> var, let and const were used for storing variables.

_According to ECMA script :-_
- let   : for using variables
- const : for using constant value

### Comments

_Comments are used for describing our code._

```JS
/* Multi line 
   Comment */

// Single Line Comment
```
### NaN

>In JS **NaN** stands for **Not a Number**.

## 5. Short hand Notation, Ternary operator and Template string

- **Short hand notation** is used for assigning values.
- **Template string** is used for formatting string.
<br>_Syntax_ : 

```JS
`Sequence of characters ${variable_name}`
```
- **Ternary operator** is used to shortend conditional statement.
<br>_Syntax_ : 

```JS
Conditional statement ? code blocks if true : code blocks if false or else code blocks   
```
>Some Examples :-
```JS
// Short hand notation

/* +=, *=, /=, %= 
   eg. a+=1 is a = a+1
*/

let a = 5, b = 5
a+=1
console.log(a)
b = b+1
console.log(b)

// Template string
   let name = 'Narayan'
   let greet = `My name is ${name} and hello.`
   console.log(greet)

// Ternary Operator
   let pass = true
   pass ? 'gate open' : 'gate closed'
```

## 6.  Loose vs Strict Comparison

**Loose comparison** : _Doesn't type check and denoted by `==`_

**Strict Comparision**: _Does type check and denoted by `===`_

```JS
let age = 25

console.log(age=='25') //loose comparision

//Strict comparision
console.log(age===25) 
console.log(age==='25')
```
## 7. Type Conversion

_It is used to convert one datatype to another if possible._
<br>Examples :-

```JS
let score = '100'
let check = True
console.log(score)

//Type conversion to number
score = Number(score)
console.log(score)

//Type conversion to boolean
check = Boolean(check)
console.log(check)

//Type conversion to string
score = String(score)
console.log(score)
```
